## Rainfall and Moisture data

- Go to https://data.tamsat.org.uk/, you will see 'Data subset service'
- For soil moisture, choose the right box. I chose dataset as "Soil Moisture V2.3.1 Daily". I suppose these are the daily estimates.
- Then timeseries over region and select 'Kenya' as region
- Then provide your email address and range for the data needed (Chose 2020 to 2025)
- And then submit job

- To obtain rainfall data, follow the same procedure  

## Yield data

How to obtain the data as distributed here:
- Go to https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QCL
- As country, select Kenya
- As Elements, select "Yield" and "Area harvested"
- As items, select "Crops, primary > List"
- Choose years: 2020 - 2024 (both inclusive)
- Then download data

Ps: We have to figure out how to use our data.
